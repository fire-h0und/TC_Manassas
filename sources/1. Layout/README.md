Inital Map layout

After picking up the idea and the theme, you need to sketch a layout of what happens and how the game will flow:
Will it "roll off the tongue" or should it stutter - will there be achoke point or not?
How many players will be present at any given time?
How will asset type "X" get (or not!) to position "Y"?

I'm most comfortable in blender - so i used it for doodling up the level mockup
I will later on use it for reference as i go about setting it up in Sandbox2 as well - so it's smart to keep it handy at all times...

As the map undegoes play test and regular use the layout might inevitably change to match and adhere to
the taste of the players actually using it - orthewise it might fade into obscurity or worse yet oblivion!

Keep the sources to remind you on the strating point and to teach you where you assumed things wrongly ;)
